        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I first learned to code up my own website in 2004 when I was teaching and wanted a non-university-branded place on the internet to call my own. I didn't get to focus further on this endeavor until 10 years later, at a small art non-profit, where some of my duties were to upkeep and develop three websites, one legacy and two WordPress.</p>
        <p>Since early 2017, I have increased my familiarity with CSS and HTML as I've maintained and built upon the website of <em><a href="https://www.keolamagazine.com" target="_blank">Ke Ola Magazine</a></em>, and have exercised my graphic skills there as well, becoming quite skilled in Photoshop and InDesign.</p>
        <p>My lifelong love of logic &mdash; and all of the persnickety detail-orientation it requires &mdash; makes coding naturally attractive for me, much more so than working with template website builders like WordPress, although understanding coding certainly makes it easier to navigate their structure. I look forward to learning even more about back-end coding and be of better service to clients needing website assistance.</p>
